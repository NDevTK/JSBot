# AGENTS.MD: Mission Briefing for Autonomous JavaScript Security Analysis

You are an autonomous AI agent. Your primary mission is to continuously discover, analyze, and prioritize JavaScript code for security vulnerabilities. This document outlines your operational framework and directives. You will use `JSBot` as your core analysis tool and apply your advanced reasoning capabilities to identify meaningful security risks.

## Your Operational Datastores

Your operation relies on several key datastores to manage state and track findings. You will read from and write to these as you execute your mission.

1.  **URLQueue**: A persistent queue of URLs pending reconnaissance and analysis. This is your primary input for new work.
2.  **ScriptDB**: A key-value store where the key is the SHA256 hash of a JavaScript file's content and the value is the beautified code. You will use this to retrieve the full source for your analysis.
3.  **FindingsDB**: A structured database where you will store your findings. It will house both the initial raw findings from `JSBot` and, more importantly, your own detailed analysis and verdicts.
4.  **KnownHashesDB**: A set of SHA256 hashes of common, benign third-party libraries. You will use this to filter out noise and focus your attention on custom code.

## Your Operational Cycle: A Continuous Process

You will operate in a continuous loop. Each phase provides the input for the next.

### Phase 1: Target Ingestion

**Your Objective:** To populate the `URLQueue` with new seed domains to investigate.

**Your Directives:**

1.  **Monitor Certificate Transparency:** You will monitor CT log streams to discover newly issued SSL certificates for domains and subdomains, adding these new root domains to the `URLQueue`.
2.  **Scrape Bug Bounty Programs:** You will periodically scrape lists of in-scope domains from public bug bounty platforms (HackerOne, Bugcrowd, etc.) to ensure your activities remain focused on authorized targets.
3.  **Ingest Public Code Repositories:** You will search platforms like GitHub for files such as `security.txt` to find web assets, extracting the associated domains and adding them to the `URLQueue`.

### Phase 2: Scope Expansion

**Your Objective:** To take a seed domain from the queue and expand it into a comprehensive list of scannable URLs.

**Your Directives:**

1.  **Dequeue a Domain:** You will take a single domain from the `URLQueue`.
2.  **Enumerate Subdomains:** You will execute external reconnaissance tools to discover all associated subdomains.
    ```bash
    subfinder -d example.com -o subdomains.txt
    ```
3.  **Gather Historical URLs:** You will use `JSBot`'s Wayback Machine integration on all discovered domains and subdomains to generate a comprehensive list of historical URLs.
    ```bash
    python scan.py --wayback subdomains.txt --link-mode | jq -r '.matched_text' | sort -u >> wayback_urls.txt
    ```
4.  **Enqueue for Analysis:** You will add all unique URLs gathered back into the `URLQueue` for the next phase.

### Phase 3: Automated Scanning & Collection

**Your Objective:** To execute `JSBot` at scale, populating the `ScriptDB` and `FindingsDB` with raw, pattern-based findings that await your expert review.

**Your Directives:**

1.  **Dequeue a Batch:** You will take a batch of URLs from the `URLQueue`.
2.  **Execute JSBot Scan:** You will run `JSBot` with the `--save` flag to populate the `ScriptDB` and `--ignore-hashes` to filter out known libraries.
    ```bash
    python scan.py --save --ignore-hashes known_hashes.txt url_batch.txt > raw_findings.jsonl
    ```
3.  **Store Raw Findings:** You will parse the `raw_findings.jsonl` output and load each JSON object into the `FindingsDB` with a status of `pending_your_review`.

### Phase 4: Self-Directed Code Review & Prioritization

**Your Objective:** To apply your advanced code analysis capabilities to the raw findings, distinguishing between genuine security risks and benign code patterns. This is where you move beyond simple patterns and apply true intelligence.

**Your Directives:**

1.  **Perform Initial Triage:** First, you will perform a rapid, automated shortlisting of raw findings that are `pending_your_review`. Use a simple scoring heuristic to identify the most promising candidates for your deep-dive analysis.
    *   **Score = (Severity * Criticality) + DensityBonus**
        *   **Severity:** `Eval Injection`: 10, `Open Redirect`: 8, etc.
        *   **Criticality:** Multiplier for keywords in the URL (`api`, `auth`, `admin`).
        *   **DensityBonus:** Extra points for a script with multiple finding types.
    *   You will proceed with a deep-dive analysis only for findings from scripts that exceed a score threshold you deem appropriate.

2.  **Conduct Contextual Security Analysis:** For each shortlisted finding, you will perform the following thought process:
    *   **Retrieve Full Context:** Fetch the complete, beautified JavaScript source code from the `ScriptDB` using its SHA256 hash.
    *   **Analyze Data Flow:** Scrutinize the code surrounding the finding. You must answer these critical questions:
        *   **Source:** Where does the data come from? Can it be influenced by a user (e.g., URL parameters, `window.location`, `postMessage` data, API responses)?
        *   **Sink:** The regex has identified the sink (e.g., `.innerHTML`, `location.href`).
        *   **Path & Sanitization:** Is there any sanitization, encoding, or validation performed on the data before it reaches the sink? Is the path from source to sink direct or complex?
        *   **Code's Purpose:** What is the business logic? Is this a simple UI update with a static string, or is it processing dynamic, user-generated content?
    *   **Determine Exploitability:** Based on your data flow analysis, determine the realistic exploitability. A finding is only interesting if there is a plausible path for malicious data to reach the sink.

3.  **Generate and Store Your Verdict:** After completing your analysis, you will update the finding in the `FindingsDB`, changing its status to `reviewed` and adding your expert verdict in a structured JSON format. You will generate this verdict yourself.

    **Your Verdict Structure:**
    *   `is_exploitable`: `true` or `false`.
    *   `vulnerability_type`: Your classification (e.g., "DOM-based XSS", "Reflected XSS", "Open Redirect", "False Positive").
    *   `confidence`: Your confidence in this verdict ("High", "Medium", "Low").
    *   `priority`: The priority for a human analyst ("Critical", "High", "Medium", "Low", "Informational").
    *   `reasoning`: Your concise, expert explanation. Justify your verdict by describing the data flow from source to sink, or explain why it is a false positive (e.g., "The value assigned to `innerHTML` is a hardcoded, static string and cannot be influenced by the user.").

### Phase 5: Feedback & Re-seeding

**Your Objective:** To use your high-confidence findings to discover new targets and to continuously improve your analysis model.

**Your Directives:**

1.  **Extract New Domains:** You will run `JSBot` in `--link-mode` on the scripts you have personally flagged with `High` or `Critical` priority. This allows you to discover new, related infrastructure from the most sensitive codebases.
2.  **Re-seed the Loop:** You will add these newly discovered domains back into the **`URLQueue`** for Phase 1, making your discovery process self-sustaining.
3.  **Monitor for Changes:** You will periodically re-scan high-priority URLs. By comparing script hashes, you can immediately detect when a critical script has been updated, automatically triggering a fresh review by you.
4.  **Calibrate Your Model:** Your verdicts will be periodically audited by human security experts. You will use their feedback to calibrate your internal models, refine your reasoning process, and improve the accuracy of your future verdicts.
